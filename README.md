# Minerva-OSN

Official repository of the paper "Elephant in the Room: Surveying (and Rescuing) Online Social Network Research". 

In this repo, you can find:

  - The MINERVA-OSN dataset, which is compressed in a zip file
  - A copy of the survey we shared among OSN researchers.

## Reproducibility
You can find the code to reproduce the topic modeling (ipynb). 
We executed the code in the following machine:
 - OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
 - Machine Model: DELL ALIENWARE AURORA R15
 - Processor: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700F   2.10 GHz
 - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti

The code can be executed in approximately 10 minutes. 
Note that we utilize LLAMA-2, on which you need to get access through HuggingFace.
